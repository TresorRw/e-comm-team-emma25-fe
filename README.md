## Testing
By either writing or running the tests you have to follow these rules:

- **Writing tests for your own features**
  1. Place your components under _`src/components`_ directory
  2. Place your test files under _`src/tests`_ directory
  3. **File name** must be written like this: `componentName.test.tsx`
- **Running the tests**
    Run 
    ```bash
    npm run test 
    ```
